###APIs/GEMs used:
- We used Devise: Devise is a gem used for user authentication. This gem was very useful as it allowed us to cut down a lot of time as we did not have to spend time on implementing our own user system. More information about Devise can be seen here : https://github.com/plataformatec/devise

- We used the PostgreSQL gem for our production version of our application. This gem allows us to use PostgreSQL databases in our application. More information about this gem can be seen here: https://rubygems.org/gems/pg/versions/0.18.4
